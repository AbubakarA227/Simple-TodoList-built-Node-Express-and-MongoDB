# Simple-TodoList-built-Node-Express-and-MongoDB
Single page todoList, built to store user todos that are updatable and deletable. A schema built to handle the content of a todo, time of creation and its current state of completion.


This is an example project to show my strength with building and consuming my own JSON API using RESTFUL practices. The API can neatly handle GET, POST, PUT and DElETE requests with no issue at all.


I kept the build light seeing as there are Front end Frameworks being used. I used Jquery to keep the state of completion consistent across the entire application, and to update and create the HTML elements.


I used Mongoose as an ORM in order to look through and grab data from my Mongo Database, and hosted everything using the event driven I/O of Node Js; as well as using Express Js as a middle-ware.
